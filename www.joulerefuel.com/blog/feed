			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re pleased to announce our 1st connected car integration &ndash; you can now automate and eliminate the everyday hassle of going to the gas station with the <a title="Automatic App" href="https://www.automatic.com/home/" target="_blank">Automatic app</a> and Joule Refuel. Together, we&rsquo;re a butler&hellip; for your car.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.joulerefuel.com/images/hiw-adapter-desktop1x-dc9f4781.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Automatic adapter plugs into the diagnostics port hidden beneath the steering wheel of most cars manufactured since 1996. The *free* Automatic app pairs with the adapter and displays useful information about your car and driving pattern. Automatic already allows its users to set low-fuel warnings, but Joule Refuel has taken the next step toward connecting your car to your digital life.</p>
<p>Simply link your <em>Vehicle Profile</em> to your Automatic dashboard via <em>My Account</em>. We&rsquo;ll send you a notification when your fuel level is low <em>and</em> prompt you to schedule your fill. Because rather than interrupt your morning routine, you deserve to sleep-in and wake-up to a full tank. And for all of you Internet of Things enthusiasts, stay tuned, because this is just the 1st chapter in <a title="Snapchat" href="http://www.joulerefuel.com/snapcode" target="_blank">our story</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>18-wheelers can hold upwards of 150 gallons of gasoline in their tanks. Let&rsquo;s say your new neighbor parked his moving truck outside your home to unload. Would you be nervous about an explosion?! Nah. You&rsquo;re concerned about him blocking your driveway. So, that concern is valid and why we aim to deliver gas to your tank with the least amount of imposition on you and your neighbors. But an explosion? Your brain is more likely to spontaneously combust when you realize you never have to go to the gas station again.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joule Refuel delivers fuels directly to vehicles. Convenient, right? But we&rsquo;re not only about convenience, we&rsquo;re about changing the face of fuel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re recreating the distribution chain for automotive refueling and you&rsquo;re the first link.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult for newer, cleaner fuels to compete in today&rsquo;s automotive economy. It&rsquo;s safe to say humankind wants to move away from fossil fuels. But a different fuel means different infrastructure. And the amount of time and money to build a new fuel infrastructure is immense. And what if that new fuel fails? [Crickets.] All that time and money was wasted.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s automotive economy is what worked <em>yesterday</em>. It&rsquo;s time to pivot.</p>
<p>By delivering fuel directly to vehicles, we&rsquo;re eliminating the need for expansive and expensive infrastructure. Our fuel delivery on-line platform and on-the-ground network make this possible. So when a car evolves from a concept to a reality, we&rsquo;re here to deliver the fuel that makes it go.</p>
<p>We're using the fuels of today to prepare the market and its users for the fuels of tomorrow.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We&rsquo;ll deliver fuel directly to your tank starting September 21st. That&rsquo;s right &ndash; we&rsquo;re cutting out the middle man. Say goodbye gas station and hello clean hands.</p>
<p><strong>Get gas delivered</strong> directly to your vehicle. We&rsquo;ll deliver to your home or office; day or night. You decide.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to the full service station? It's back and it's better, because we're bringing it to you.</p>
<p>Did we mention there's <strong>no delivery fee</strong>? Yep. All you pay for is the price for fuel and our price per gallon is likely cheaper than stations in and around your neighborhood.</p>
